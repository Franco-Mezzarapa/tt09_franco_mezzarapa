## How it Works

This piece of hardware takes in serial input and de-serializes it into a key and a message. It then performs an XOR encryption on the message using the key and re-serializes the resulting ciphertext for output.

The design includes options for replacing the key with hardwired keys, using no key, or triggering reset-based preformatted keys. Additionally, formatted debug output is provided for monitoring and verification.

The original design, located on a separate tile, does not include these optional hardware features. It uses a fixed configuration without support for alternate keys, debug outputs, or reset-based key replacement.

## How to Test

You can test this hardware by sending a key and a message serially, using the respective inputs to trigger flags that indicate the type of data being sent. Once the key and message are received, the output provides a serial ciphertext generated by XOR encryption.

Optional hardware features can be tested by activating the respective inputs for:
- Hardwired keys
- Reset-based preformatted keys
- No-key operation

The formatted debug output can also be monitored to confirm correct operation.

## External Hardware

This project interfaces with an ESP32 through the PMOD connector, requiring a clock to synchronize the hardware and the microcontroller.
